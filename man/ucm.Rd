\description{
Function \code{ucm} decomposes a time series into components such as trend, seasonal, cycle, and the regression effects due to predictor series using Unobserved Components Model (UCM).
}
\details{
Formula of the model can be of the forma as in \code{lm} with response variable on rhs and predictor variables or 0 (if no predictor variables) on the rhs.
}
\examples{
modelNile <- ucm(Nile~0, data = Nile, slope = TRUE)
modelNile
modelNile$s.level
}
